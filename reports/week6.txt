Name: Cory Smith
Project Title: zRogue

Team Members: None

Overall Status: Behind

Number of hours worked since last update: 12
Number of hours worked on the project thus far: 33
Total number of hours anticipated for completion: 93

Accomplishments:I have the "terminal" renderering along with the capability 
for ascii characters to be colored with unique foregrounds and backgrounds.
All of this is done GPU side, and there is a nice layer for someone to use it.


Challenges: Getting things rendering this way. Getting the dimensions correct
was a massive hassel. 

Plans / Goals for next week: Get this loop rendering in a browser with Emscripten.


Accountability plan: I honestly dont have one, and probably should
talk with you during offices hours. 

Other comments: I have been completely distracted with my internship and 
this project has been slowly falling to the side. Not that I havent been working
on it, but taking the step into GPU rendering was something that I probably 
should not have done. Getting libraries configured was the difficult part, 
not even the coding shaders or anything. I just introduced complexity too early.
But that being said, that was the biggest road block for the project. Now
I just need to make a simple game, and document it. Along with provide a nice
abstraction for input handling and the core aspect of the library will be
finished. The main problem is I want to build something that is cool
and something that I would be proud to talk about. Maybe I just need some 
advice for taking things at a more resonable pace, or in a more realistic way.
