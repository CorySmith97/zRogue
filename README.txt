This is a library designed to help zig developers build a simple roguelike game in zig.
Wherever possible I am aiming to handle everything in zig. There is however one 
library that will be used is SDL2. The library construction is heavily inspired
by the sokol headers as well as bracket lib. 

=== Library structure ===

There are several modules within the library.

- app
- algorithms


=== How to use? ===

As of right now the build is only avaible for mac. In order to build you need to have
the master branch of zig downloaded(zig 0.13.0). Along with the latest version of zig,
you need to have SDL2 downloaded at a system level.
